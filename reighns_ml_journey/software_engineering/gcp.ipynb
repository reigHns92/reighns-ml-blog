    "## GCP Bucket \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial for myself on how to setup GCP Bucket and use python to upload/download files. These are references here[^stackoverflow].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create GCP Bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create GCP Bucket here by following the steps here[^GCP Bucket].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Google Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the Cloud Client Libraries for Python for an individual API like Cloud Storage\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!pip install --upgrade google-cloud-storage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Cloud SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Cloud SDK which can be used to access Cloud Storage services from the command line and then do `gcloud auth application-default login`. Note that this command generates credentials for client libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are detailed here[^install Cloud SDK].\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, we need to install `gcloud`.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!pip install gcloud\n",

    "& $env:Temp\\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Setup Service Account\n",
    "\n",
    "We open `cmd` prompt, `cd` to the directory where you are working on, then type `gcloud auth login`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I do not have a service account, we follow this link[^service account] and follow the steps using either the Cloud Consoler or Command Line. (I prefer the Cloud Console). The documentation is clear and you just need to follow the steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a service account key by the following:\n",
    "1. In the Cloud Console, click the email address for the service account that you created.\n",
    "2. Click Keys.\n",
    "3. Click Add key, then click Create new key.\n",
    "4. Click Create. A JSON key file is downloaded to your computer.\n",
    "5. Click Close.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Authenticated Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have a `json` file from previous step. Put the `json` file in a folder. Then everytime you start a terminal or new window, you can use \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"$PATH$TO$JSON\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "It seems a hassle to type the command everytime. May look into this link[^GCP python] and this[^GCP python CLI] to see how to setup the environment.\n",
