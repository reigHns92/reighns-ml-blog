    "Create a file named `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` concurrently. The latter should have the libraries that one is interested in having for his project while the formal is a `setup.py` file where it contains the setup object which describes how to set up our package and it's dependencies. The first several lines cover metadata (name, description, etc.) and then we define the requirements. Here we're stating that we require a Python version equal to or above 3.8 and then passing in our required packages to install_requires. Finally, we define extra requirements that different types of users may require. This is a standard practice and more can be understood from madewithml.com.\n",

    "4. Along the way you need to create a few folders, follow the page tree in mkdocs.yml, everything should be created in `docs/` folder.\n",
    "5. As an example, in our reighns-linear-regression folder, we want to show two scenarios:\n",
    "    - Scenario 1: I merely want a full markdown file to show on the website. In this case, in the \"watch\", we specify a path we want to watch in our `docs/` folder. In this case, I created a `documentation` folder under `docs/` so I specify that. Next in the `docs/documentation/` folder I create a file called `linear_regression.md` where I dump all my markdown notes inside. Then in the `nav` tree in `mkdocs.yml`, specify\n",

    "    Note that Home and Getting Started are optional but let us keep it for the sake of completeness. What you need to care is \"Detailed Notes\" and note the path I gave to them - which will point to the folders in `docs/documentation/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Scenario 2: I want a python file with detailed docstrings to appear in my static website. This is slightly more complicated. First if you want a new section of this you can create a section called `code_reference`, both under the `nav` above and also in the folder `docs/`, meaning `docs/code_reference/` must exist. Put it under watch as well. Now in `docs/code_reference/` create a file named say `linear_regression_from_scratch.md` and put `::: src.linear_regression` inside, note that you should not have space in between.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you copy and paste the URL given by MkDocs into your browser you\n",
    "will see your website preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Website Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown files added under the `docs/` folder will be converted\n",
    "to HTML pages on your website. This website template enables some\n",
    "helpful extensions for\n",
    "\n",
    "- rendering of math in LaTeX style,\n",
    "- admonitions such as notes and warnings, and\n",
    "- code blocks with syntax highlighting.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Deploying Your Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready to deploy your website for the first time, make an\n",

    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ git add .\n",
    "$ git commit -a -m \"Initial Commit\"\n",
    "$ git push origin master -u\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activate Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub Actions deployment workflow included with this template\n",
    "runs whenever you push to the `master` branch. This workflow will\n",
    "build your website using MkDocs and push the built website files to\n",
    "the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, which GitHub Pages can use\n",
    "to serve your website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have pushed your changes, go to your repository page on\n",
    "GitHub and confirm that the GitHub Actions workflow has completed\n",
    "successfully (you should see a green checkmark next to the name of the\n",
    "most recent commit). Then, go to your repository settings page, and\n",
    "click on 'Pages'. You will see a section that will let you set the\n",
    "source for your GitHub Pages website. Click the box labelled 'None'\n",
    "and select the `gh-pages` branch. Leave the selectd folder at '/\n",
    "(root)' and click 'Save'. Your website is now live!\n",
    "\n",
    "To push additional changes, simply commit and push to the master\n",
    "branch. The GitHub Actions deployment workflow will handle deploying\n",
    "your changes to GitHub Pages.\n",

    "### Pandoc (Markdown Converter)\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, you will need to convert a jupyter notebook to markdown file for deployment (as markdown supports Admonitions in Mkdocs). Here is a way to do it, it is very convenient as it not only converts your notebook files to markdown, it also stores your output as images in a folder for you.

    "### Path Environment\n",

    "Now go to Advanced System Settings and click on Environment Variables. You will see a list of environment variables. You can add a new environment variable by clicking on the plus sign in the **System Variables**. Add the path recommended by `jupyter` to the `PATH` variable.
