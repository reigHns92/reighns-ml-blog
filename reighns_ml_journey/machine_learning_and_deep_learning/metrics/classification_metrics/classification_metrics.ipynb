    "This notebook attempts to describe the commonly used Classification Metrics in details; you will find the pros and cons of each metric, alongside with examples to illustrate. I will refer to scikit-learn's official website for reference, specifically, the [section on Model Evaluation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html). I may quote some definitions verbatim, if necessary.\n",

    "    Consider a training dataset consisting of 1000 patients where we want to train a classifier to \"accurately\" classify whether a patient has cancer (positive class 1) or no cancer (negative class 0). The dataset is dichotimized by 950 benign patients and the remaining 50, cancerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ZeroR classifier (baseline classification model) predicts only the majority class. And in our case, the in-sample training set accuracy will be $0.95\\%$ since it predicts all sample to be benign; for completeness, we also assume a validation set with 1000 patients (990 benign and 10 cancerous), it follows that our validation set's accuracy will be $0.99\\%$. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Euphoria is at all time high over this result, surprised that a baseline model can perform so well, you then happily reported this result to your boss, and gets fired immediately. You drown in tears and googled \"Is accuracy a bad metric?\", only to learn a valuable lesson: since the model you trained will predict benign no matter the input, this means it completely missed out every single cancerous patient even though you get a 99 percent accuracy. Should your model ever be deployed as a \"cancer detector\", you will be responsible for indirectly causing many patients' death.\n",
