If you plot out the solution set, this is just a straight line $x + y = 0$ that passes through the origin. Then if you write it as $x = -y$, then this means $x$ depends on $y$, in which $y$ can be any point on the line. Similarly, if we ignore the definition of free variable, we can also write $y = -x$ and recover our favourite high school equation of a line where $y$ depends on $x$ and $x$ being independent is allowed to take on any values. But matrix theory now gives us a systematic way to approach things, we just need to know that if our unknowns is more than the equations, we are usually bound to have free variables."
