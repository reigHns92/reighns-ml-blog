    "\n",
    "A clear example is the set of outcomes of a single coin toss, which can result in either heads or tails, but not both. To be concise, let the event of coin landing on head be $A$, the event of coin landing on tails be $B$, event $A$ and $B$ can never occur at the same time, it is the case that one cannot be true if the other one is true, or at least one of them cannot be true. \n",

    "Also, by **Unions of Two Non-Disjoint Sets**, it is easy to see that $\\P(A \\cup B) = \\P(A) + \\P(B)$ since $\\P(A \\cap B) = 0$. For the coin toss example, since $A \\cup B$ spans the entire sample space, it is intuitive that $P(A \\cup B)$ (the probability of throwing a head OR a tail) is 1."
