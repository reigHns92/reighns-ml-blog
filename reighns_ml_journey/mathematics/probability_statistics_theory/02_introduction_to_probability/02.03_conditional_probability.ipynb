    "> Therefore, after the intuition, one should not be constantly checking what the formula represents, if we have $\\P(A ~|~ B)$, then it just means given $B$ has happened, what is the probability of $A$ happening? The logic becomes apparent when we reduce the whole sample space $\\S$ to be only $B$ now, and that whatever $A$ overlaps with $B$ will be the probability of this conditional. "
