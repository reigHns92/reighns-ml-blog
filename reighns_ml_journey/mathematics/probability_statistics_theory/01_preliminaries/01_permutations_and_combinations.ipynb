    "We start off with a simple example. Let us assume we have to choose lunch and dinner on an airplane. We were offered 2 choices in lunch menu and 3 choices in dinner menu which we denote $l_1, l_2$ and $d_1, d_2, d_3$ respectively. \n",

The same can be said if we see $2 \\times 3$ as $2 + 2 + 2$, as we can fix dinner as $d_1$ and ask, how many choices do we have now? The answer is 2, and we see that there are 3 dinner, so add them thrice."

    "\n",
    "This can be first understood that our denominator is the total outcomes in our sample space $\\S$. This is $36$, why? By our counting principle on multiplication, we know that if we have $6$ choices in roll $1$ and $6$ choices in roll 2, then the cross-product is $6 \\times 6 = 36$ total choices. One can enumerate $\\{(1,1), (1,2), \\ldots, (6,6)\\}$ to see why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the numerator is also related to the counting principle of multiplication as well! In roll 1, rolling a 5 is 1 choice, rolling a 6 next is 1 choice, so total there is a only one combination choice $1 \\times 1$!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we reframe the problem to what is the probability that you roll a 1, 2 or 3 in the first roll and 2 or 3 in the second roll. Then of course our denominator don't change as $36$, but our numerator changes, since in roll 1 we have 3 choices, and roll 2 have 2 choices, by the multiplicative principle we have a total of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ choices, and so our probability is $\\dfrac{6}{36}$ now. You can verify that there are indeed $6$ choices manually.\n",
