    "> This inequality provides an **upper bound** for the dot product between two vectors; in other words, the absolute value of the dot product between two vectors cannot be larger than the product of the norms of the individual vectors. Note that the inequality can become an equality if and only if both vectors are the zero vector $\\0$ or if one vector (either one) is scaled by the other vector $\\v = \\lambda \\w$.  - **Mike X Cohen, Linear Algebra: Theory, Intuition, Code**\n",

Geometrically, we know that we just need to divide the vector $\\v$ by $5$ (a.k.a the norm of the vector itself) to get a vector that has norm $1$ and also lies in the same direction. But how to recover the exact vector $\\u$ with its coordinates?
