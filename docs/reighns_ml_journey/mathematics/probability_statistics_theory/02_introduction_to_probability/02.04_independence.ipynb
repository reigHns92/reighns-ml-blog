    "### Intuition (Independence)\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula above is not at all intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more intuitive way to think about it is to think that two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if the occurrence of $B$ does not affect the probability of the occurrence of $A$. This can be illustrated further with the following narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume the scenario: given that $B$ occurred (with or without event $A$ occurring), what is the probability of event $A$ occurring? In other words, we are now in the universe in which $B$ occurred - which is the full right circle. In that right hand side circle ($B$), the probability of $A$ is the area of $A$ intersect $B$ divided by the area of the circle - or in other words, the probability of $A$ is the number of outcomes of $A$ in the right circle (which is $n(A \\cap B)$, over the number of outcomes of the reduced sample space $B$. Therefore, if we think of independence as event $B$ occuring not affecting event $A$ occurring, then it means that the probability of $A$ occurring is still the probability of $A$ occurring. i.e $\\P(A|B) = \\P(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows immediately that $$P(A) = P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\Longrightarrow P(A) P(B) = P(A \\cap B)$$\n",

    "    <b>Fig 1</b>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> So the intuition can be understood by using conditional, say $\\P(A ~|~ B)$, if $A$ and $B$ are truly independent, then even if $B$ happened, the probability of $A$ should remain unchanged, which means that $\\P(A ~|~ B) = \\P(A)$, but also recall the definition of conditionals, $\\P(A ~|~ B) = \\dfrac{\\P(A \\cap B)}{B}$, so equating them we have the nice equation of $\\P(A)\\P(B) = \\P(A \\cap B)$.\n",

    "which amounts to $\\P(A) = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}$. Now if $C$ happened, we know that the two rolls have a sum of $8$, and we cannot construct a sum of $8$ with a roll of $1$. To me, I immediately know that event $A$ cannot have the outcome that has a $1$ in the second roll, and thus the outcomes should only be limited to $5$ instead of $6$ and hence dependence is established.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe somewhere my intuition is flawed, the author mentioned that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you like a more intuitive argument, you can imagine that C has happened, i.e., the sum is 8. Then the probability for the first die to be 1 is 0 because there is no way to construct 8 when the first die is 1. As a result, we have eliminated one choice for the first die, leaving only five options. Therefore, since C has influenced the probability of A, they are dependent.\n",
