    "The intuition of this is also apparent after understanding that if a sample space can be broken down into disjoint events $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_k$, then any event $B$ that is in the sample space must touch some of these disjoint events, whenever they overlap, we can represent them as $\\P(A_i \\cap B)$, and if we add them up it is just the event $B$ itself. If they don't overlap, we can still add them anyways since $P(A_k \\cap B) = 0$. Note the loose usage of the index here, $i$ means overlap, $k$ means non-overlap."

By our counting principle on multiplication, we know that if we have $6$ choices in roll $1$ and $6$ choices in roll 2, then the cross-product is $6 \\times 6 = 36$ total choices. One can enumerate $\\{(1,1), (1,2), \\ldots, (6,6)\\}$ to see why.\n",

    "Now if we reframe the problem to what is the probability that you roll a 1, 2 or 3 in the first roll and 2 or 3 in the second roll. Then of course our denominator don't change as $36$, but our numerator changes, since in roll 1 we have 3 choices, and roll 2 have 2 choices, by the multiplicative principle we have a total of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ choices, and so our probability is $\\dfrac{6}{36}$ now. You can verify that there are indeed $6$ choices manually.\n",
