So, the term likelihood is just shorthand to refer to the probability $P(x|\\theta)$ for some data $x$ that results from assigning different values to $\\theta$ (e.g. as one traverses the search space of $\\theta$ for a good solution). So, it is often used as an objective function, but also as a performance measure to compare two models as in [Bayesian model comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor). \n",
