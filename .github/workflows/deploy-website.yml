      - name: Compile Jupyter Notebooks to Markdown
        # We use a combination of `find` and `parallel` to efficiently
        # compile all Jupyter Notebooks in the docs/ folder and its
        # subdirectories ot markdown using `nbconvert`. With `find`,
        # we can query files and folders by name, type, and other
        # characteristics. We configure `find` to print the paths of
        # matching files to standard output.
        #
        # We pipe the standard output of `find` to `parallel`, which
        # reads each path to a matching IPYNB file as an entry. For
        # each entry, `parallel` starts a _job_ to run a shell command
        # formed from the entry. Jobs run in parallel based on the
        # multiprocessing capacity of the computer.
        #
        # Explanation of `find` options:
        #
        # -type f
        #   Match only files
        # -name "*.ipynb"
        #   Match only paths ending with `.ipynb`
        # -print0
        #   Print each matching path to standard output, separating each
        #   entry with a NULL character
        #
        # Explanation of `parallel` options:
        #
        # -0
        #   Read entries separated with a NULL character
        # --progress
        #   Display progress of ongoing and queued jobs
        # --halt now,fail=1
        #   Stop immediately if any job fails, killing all other
        #   running jobs
        # 'jupyter nbconvert --to markdown {}'
        #   For each job, run the above string as a shell command,
        #   substituting the entry contents (e.g., the path to one
        #   IPYNB file) for {}.
        #
        #   The shell command for the job is escaped in single-
        #   quotes to prevent the shell from expanding or parsing
        #   any special characters (e.g., curly braces) prematurely.
